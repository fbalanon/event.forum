# Final Project for JavaScript Development class at General Assembly

Created an event forum so friends could visit the site, search events (on Eventbrite), save favorites, and vote on the events they would like to attend.


### Three Technical Hurdles

    1 - Finding the right API (data and language)
    2 - API responses may vary (some data may be missing)
    3 - Getting the DIVs the same height


### Two Things Learned

    1 - useful data could cost
    2 - learned how to pivot into something similarly useful, based on resources
